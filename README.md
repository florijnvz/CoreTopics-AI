# CoreTopics-AI
# Empathic Medical Message Rewriter (TinyLlama)

This repo contains the code for my Core Topics: AI assignment.

- `EmpathyRewriter.ipynb` – main notebook:
  - loads TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat,
  - defines three prompting modes (direct, chain-of-thought, self-check),
  - runs Scenarios A (low-stakes), B (serious), and C (crash-test),
  - prints model outputs for analysis.

How to run:
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
2. Run the first cell to install dependencies.
3. Run all cells from top to bottom.
